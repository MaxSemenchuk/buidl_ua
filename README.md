# Welcome to BUIDL ua community

BUIDL ua is a community of  blockchain developers in Ukraine.

Our vision is to support the creation of more cool blockchain products in Ukraine through:

* building [the community](directory.md) connections through [meetups](meetups/) and chat \(ping [@Polygnom](https://t.me//Polygnom) to get invited\)
* expertise exchange
* cross function collaboration
* participation in the global movement \(hackathons, discussion\)
* supporting the value of decentralization values in Ukraine 
* building teams and product concepts \(check our drafts on [DevX](research/devx/), [Usability](research/usability/) and [Interoperability](research/interoperability/)\)
